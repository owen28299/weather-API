Project Set-up

Your project directory should look like:

public
├── css
│  └── styles.css
├── index.html
└── js
    ├── client.js
    └── open_weather.js (this is for the stretch goal of making a module)
notes: css, index.html and js directories are all siblings and located inside of public/ of your project.

Goal (MVP)

There should be an input field where the User is able to input a city's name. Once the city name has been entered, there should be a button to trigger the XHR request to get a 5-day weather forecast data from OpenWeather. Display the data the best you can.

you must vanilla javascript xhr.

use git, commit often!
